# librarymanagementsystem
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is a console-based Library Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. It simulates the core functionalities of a real-world library, such as managing books, users, issuing and returning books, and tracking transactions.
